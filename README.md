# Ray-Tracer-Project-

A ray tracer is a computer graphics algorithm used to simulate the way light interacts with objects in a 3D scene. It's the technology behind photorealistic rendering in movies, video games, and design software.

⚙️ How It Works
Ray tracing mimics how our eyes perceive the world—by tracing the path of light rays from the eye (camera) into the scene. Here's a breakdown of the process:

Ray Casting: Rays are projected from the camera through each pixel into the scene.

Intersection Testing: The algorithm checks which objects the rays hit and where.

Shading: Once an intersection is found, the color of the surface is computed based on materials, light sources, and shadows.

Reflection & Refraction: Secondary rays may be traced for mirrors and transparent surfaces, adding realism.

Global Illumination: Advanced ray tracers simulate indirect lighting, caustics, and ambient effects.
